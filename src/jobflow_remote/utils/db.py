class MongoLock:
    """
    Context manager to lock a document in a MongoDB database.

    Main characteristics and functionalities:
        * Lock is acquired by setting a lock_id and lock_time value in the
          locked document.
        * Filter the document to select based on a query and sorting.
          It uses find_one_and_update, thus resulting in a single document locked.
        * Can wait for a lock to be released.
        * Can forcibly break an existing lock
        * Can return the locked document even if the lock could not be acquired
          (useful for determining if a document is locked or no document matches
          the query)
        * Accepts all the arguments that can be passed to find_one_and_update
        * A custom update can be performed on the document when acquiring the lock.
        * Allows to pass properties that will be set in the document at the moment
          of releasing the lock.
        * Lock id value can be customized. If not a randomly generated uuid is used.

    Examples
    --------

    Trying to acquire the lock on a document based on the state
    >>> with MongoLock(collection, {"state": "READY"}) as lock:
    ...     print(lock.locked_document["state"])
    READY

    If lock cannot be acquired (no document matching filter or that
    document is locked) the `lock.locked_document` is None.

    >>> with MongoLock(collection, {"state": "READY"}) as lock:
    ...     print(lock.locked_document)
    None

    Wait for 60 seconds in case the required document is already locked.
    Check the status every 10 seconds. If lock cannot be acquired
    locked_document is None

    >>> with MongoLock(
            collection,
            {"uuid": "5b84228b-d019-47fe-b0a0-564b36aa85ed"},
            sleep=10,
            max_wait=60,
        ) as lock:
    ...     print(lock.locked_document)
    None

    In case lock cannot be acquired expose the locked document

    >>> with MongoLock(
            collection,
            {"uuid": "5b84228b-d019-47fe-b0a0-564b36aa85ed"},
            get_locked_doc=True,
        ) as lock:
    ...     print(lock.locked_document)
    None
    ...     print(lock.unavailable_document['lock_id'])
    8d68404f-c77a-461b-859c-40bb0af1979f

    Set values in the document upon lock release

    >>> with MongoLock(collection, {"state": "READY"}) as lock:
    ...     if lock.locked_document:
    ...         # Perform some operations based on the job...
    ...         lock.update_on_release = {"$set": {"state": "CHECKED_OUT"}}

        Parameters

        filter
            A MongoDB query to select the document.
        update
            A dictionary that will be passed to find_one_and_update to update the
            locked document at the moment of acquiring the lock.
        break_lock
            True if the context manager is allowed to forcibly break a lock.
        lock_id
            The is used for the lock in the document. If None a randomly generated
            uuid will be used.
        sleep
            The amount of second to sleep between consecutive checks while waiting
            for a lock to be released.
        max_wait
            The amount of seconds to wait for a lock to be released.

            The projection passed to the find_one_and_update that locks the document.

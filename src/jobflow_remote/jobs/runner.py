class Runner:
    """
    Object orchestrating the execution of all the Jobs.

    Advances the status of the Jobs, handles the communication with the workers
    and updates the queue and output databases.

    The main entry point is the `run` method. It is supposed to be executed
    by a daemon, but can also be run directly for testing purposes.
    It allows to run all the steps required to advance the Job's states or even
    a subset of them, to parallelize the different tasks.

    The runner instantiates a pool of workers and hosts given in the project
    definition. A single connection will be opened if multiple workers share
    the same host.

    The Runner schedules the execution of the specific tasks at regular intervals
    and relies on objects like QueueManager, BaseHost and JobController to
    interact with workers and databases.
